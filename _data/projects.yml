    Have you ever used a credit card at a store only to be declined? Or have the payments been blocked because you were charged a higher amount. Credit Card Fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using a credit Card or any similar payment mechanism as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction.Despite the introduction of secure chip technology, credit card fraud remains a top concern for banks and financial institutions. A report published by “Nilson” shows that global credit card fraud losses equaled $22.8 billion in 2016.

      **Contributions:**
       
       - Built model using past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud and then used it to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.
       - Applied Sampling techniques (Under Sampling and SMOTE) to resolve the imbalanced issue where 99.83% of the transactions in the data set were not fraudulent while only 0.17% were fraudulent. 
       - Used Precision, Recall and F1-score to evaluate the results.

      **Contributions:**
       
       - Designed an end-to-end sales data warehouse using Pentaho DI and performed various transformations on the data (Row Normalizer, Database Lookup, if field value is null)
       - Designed a database using Star Schema and built a multi-dimensional cube using Mondrian
       - Configured the Pentaho BI server to deploy reports by creating a database connection in Pentaho Enterprise Console for central usage. 
       - Also, conducted analysis using the inbuilt Saiku Analytics Plugin and created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to demonstrate the results using pie chart, bar graphs, data blending feature and bubble charts.

      **Contributions:**
      
      - Built a model that identifies the factors influencing the world happiness with 92% accuracy 
      - Performed hypothesis test on the data set, built a regression model and performed predictive analysis using R.
      - Used classification algorithms like KNN, Naïve Bayes and logistic regression to validate the results.
      - Performed data cleansing and preprocessing using R statistical packages. 
      - Used correlation matrix to evaluate the correlation among variables and then used N-fold cross evaluation.
      - Performed back-ward elimination and eliminated variables that were greater than the p value(depending on confidence interval) at each step. 
      - Also used predict() function to predict the variables that affected the most and RMSE (Root mean square error) to check the accuracy of the prediction.
